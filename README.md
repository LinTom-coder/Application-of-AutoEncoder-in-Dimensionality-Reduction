# Application-of-AutoEncoder-in-Dimensionality-Reduction
This is an assignment from the **Deep Learning** course, focusing on the development and implementation of **AE**.

## Description
An autoencoder is a type of neural network designed to learn low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional input data, making it useful for dimensionality reduction.
It consists of two main components:
- **Encoder**: Compresses the input into a low-dimensional latent vector.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original input from the latent representation.
